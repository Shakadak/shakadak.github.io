About what ?

### About this blog

I am a student at 42, a school in Paris, France that form to the title of architect in digital technologies.
Here you've got some background about me. Not really helpful about knowing me, I know, but fear not. You will come to discover me through this blog anyway.  
So let's get to know more about my blog, since this is the aim of this page.

Why is it ?  
I feel the need to express myself about various thing. Mostly regarding philosophy. Introspection is a huge thing too me. But what's the point of having all these reflections if I don't share the result from them. Considering the ever changing flow of thoughts that constitute my mind, it will be a hard task. So I intend to use my passion of programming to log my learning journey, and while doing that to input from time to time a bit of what makes my mind.  
I hope you will be able to enjoy your ride on the road that will become that blog.
