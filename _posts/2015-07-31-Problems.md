Two ways to approach a problem:

* Solve it.
* Make it non-existent.

The second option could be reworded using the idiom: Prevention is better than cure.

Although these two possibilities end up with potentially the same result, they probably should not be considered as parallel.
I believe that the latter provides greater benefit over the former despite working outside the problem space. But I did not put enought thought into this to write on it at the moment.  
On quick exemple that could be taken from the programming world would be null pointer. Some languages simply removed it through the use of sum types and deconstruction / pattern matching.

I am curious about what other problems have been approached (or are trying to be approached) by providing something upstream rather than downstream.
If you have any idea feel free to email me.
