Okay, so here is my first blogpost. (The two dating from 2014/12/26 don't count.) I've never done one before. That is why I am starting it as rough as that.  
Well, to be honest, it isn't that raw. There is a title before all. I'm not going to explain here what the [title](https://shakadak.github.io/404) [rule](https://shakadak.github.io/404) is. You will have to wait a bit for it.  
Anyway, let's jump back to topic. English is not my native language. So if you ever think of correcting me, do so. With some depth if possible, just so that I can use that explanation whenever necessary in the future.  
Okay, that was quick, that was short, possibly not exhaustive, but I still haven't done that [about](../about) page. Good night reader.
